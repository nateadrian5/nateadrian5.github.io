## Project Overview
The original project was a solitaire game that was written in Ruby for a 300 level CS course. It is a version of one-handed solitaire. The game play is automated but allows stepping through it interactively. It is a simple command line interface with no GUI.

### Code Review
The code review was completed and can be seen in the following video: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B-wucU2X-tE4GrbXRjbZBfcfN7-erDXr/view?usp=sharing)
